#ClaudiaWeather
I'm glad to share my Claudia Weather App

It is a React app that provides weather descriptions for cities.

Features:
It provides searching utility for cities all over the world and gets specified data about weather.

It provides a detailed response including (Humidity percentage, Wind speed, Precipitation, and Pressure).

It also provides 8-day forecast with the same details mentioned before and a 24-hour forecast.

This app is built using React.JS and with the help of 2 APIs:
GeoDB Cities API that helps in presenting a select list.
OpenWeatherMap API that helps in fetching weather data.
